# REMI Story - Modularization & Best Practices Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to modularize and future-proof the REMI Story codebase, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and reusability. The goal is to transform the current codebase into a well-organized, feature-driven architecture that can easily scale and be maintained by teams.

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

### Goal
Organize by feature/domain, not by type, to keep related files together and make scaling easier.

### Current Structure Issues
- Components, pages, and services are scattered across different directories
- No clear separation of concerns by feature
- Difficult to understand which files belong to which feature

### Target Structure

### Action Steps
1. Create the new directory structure
2. Move files incrementally, starting with the most isolated features
3. Update all import statements
4. Create index.ts files for clean exports
5. Update TypeScript paths if needed

## 2. Context & State Management

### Goal
Keep contexts focused and colocate them with their main consumers.

### Current State
- UserContext, SphereContext, and ModalContext are global
- Some contexts might be used only by specific features

### Improvements
- **Feature-specific contexts**: Move contexts that are only used by one feature into that feature folder
- **Global contexts**: Keep truly global contexts (user, modal, sphere) in `context/` but ensure they are lean
- **Custom hooks**: Use custom hooks for derived state or complex logic, keeping contexts simple

### Action Steps
1. Audit context usage across the codebase
2. Identify contexts that can be moved to feature folders
3. Refactor contexts to be more focused and lean
4. Create custom hooks for complex state logic

## 3. Component Best Practices

### Goal
Make components small, focused, and reusable.

### Current Issues
- Some components are too large and handle multiple responsibilities
- Mixing of presentation and business logic
- Inconsistent prop interfaces

### Improvements
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate presentation from business logic
- **Consistent Interfaces**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Use composition patterns for flexibility

### Action Steps
1. Break large components into smaller, focused components
2. Extract business logic into custom hooks
3. Create consistent prop interfaces
4. Add proper TypeScript types for all components

## 4. Hooks & Services

### Goal
Encapsulate logic and side effects for reuse and testability.

### Current State
- Hooks are scattered across different directories
- Some business logic is mixed with components
- Services are in a separate directory but not feature-specific

### Improvements
- **Feature-specific hooks**: Move hooks into their respective feature folders
- **Global hooks**: Keep truly global hooks in `hooks/`
- **Service organization**: Colocate services with features or keep shared services in `services/`
- **Custom hooks**: Create hooks for complex state management and side effects

### Action Steps
1. Audit all hooks and their usage
2. Move feature-specific hooks to feature folders
3. Refactor complex components to use custom hooks
4. Organize services by feature or shared usage

## 5. Type Safety & Documentation

### Goal
Make the codebase self-documenting and robust.

### Current State
- Basic TypeScript usage
- Limited documentation
- Some any types and loose typing

### Improvements
- **Strict TypeScript**: Use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Comprehensive Types**: Create interfaces for all data structures
- **JSDoc Documentation**: Document complex functions, hooks, and contexts
- **Type Guards**: Use type guards for runtime type checking

### Action Steps
1. Enable strict TypeScript configuration
2. Create comprehensive type definitions
3. Add JSDoc comments to complex functions
4. Implement type guards where needed
5. Create README files for each feature

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Goal
Ensure reliability and code quality.

### Current State
- No testing setup
- Basic linting
- No code quality tools

### Improvements
- **Unit Testing**: Set up Jest + React Testing Library
- **Component Testing**: Test critical components and hooks
- **Service Testing**: Test API and business logic
- **Linting & Formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use Husky for automated quality checks

### Action Steps
1. Set up Jest and React Testing Library
2. Configure ESLint and Prettier
3. Set up Husky for pre-commit hooks
4. Write tests for critical components and hooks
5. Create testing guidelines and examples

## 7. Performance & Optimization

### Goal
Ensure the application performs well at scale.

### Improvements
- **Code Splitting**: Use React.lazy for route-based code splitting
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use tools to analyze bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Optimize images and use lazy loading

### Action Steps
1. Implement code splitting for routes
2. Add memoization where beneficial
3. Set up bundle analysis
4. Optimize images and assets

## 8. Continuous Refactoring

### Goal
Make refactoring a habit, not a one-time event.

### Improvements
- **Regular Reviews**: Schedule regular code reviews
- **Refactoring Guidelines**: Create guidelines for when and how to refactor
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Track and address technical debt
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Encourage team knowledge sharing

### Action Steps
1. Create refactoring guidelines
2. Set up regular code review processes
3. Create technical debt tracking system
4. Establish knowledge sharing practices

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Add monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Create deployment pipelines

## Success Metrics

- **Code Organization**: All files are properly organized by feature
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with strict configuration
- **Test Coverage**: >80% test coverage for critical paths
- **Performance**: Bundle size reduced by 20%
- **Maintainability**: Reduced complexity scores
- **Developer Experience**: Faster development cycles

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental Migration**: Move files one feature at a time
- **Backup Strategy**: Use Git branches for each phase
- **Testing**: Ensure tests pass after each change
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated throughout the process

## Conclusion

This modularization plan will transform the REMI Story codebase into a scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly application. By following these steps incrementally, we can ensure a smooth transition while maintaining application functionality and improving code quality.

The key is to approach this as an ongoing process rather than a one-time refactor, continuously improving the codebase as new features are added and requirements evolve.
