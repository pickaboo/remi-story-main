# REMI Story – Best Practices Audit & Recommendations

_Audit Date: 2025-06-27_

## Project Health Summary

- **Feature-based structure:** Clear and modern
- **Functional components:** No class components
- **Custom hooks:** Well-organized, use `use` prefix
- **Context:** Used for global state
- **TypeScript:** Most files/components are typed

---

## Key Issues Found

- **Use of `any`:** Found in several places. Replace with specific types or interfaces.
- **Deep Relative Imports:** Many imports like `import { X } from '../../../../types'`. Recommend switching to absolute imports via `tsconfig.json`.
- **Default Exports:** Found in some files. Prefer named exports for consistency.
- **Unused/Legacy Imports:** Some files may import from now-nonexistent paths. Double-check all imports after moving files.
- **Explicit/Implicit `any` in Functions:** Some function parameters or returns are not typed. Always type function parameters and return values.
- **Component/File Naming:** Most files use PascalCase. Continue this convention.
- **Class Components:** None found. ✅
- **Hooks:** All custom hooks are in the right folders and use the `use` prefix. ✅
- **Linting/Formatting:** Code style appears consistent, but ensure ESLint and Prettier are set up and run regularly.

## Actionable Next Steps

1. Replace all `any` types with specific types/interfaces.
2. Switch to named exports for all components and utilities.
3. Configure absolute imports in `tsconfig.json` for easier imports (see below for example).
4. Run ESLint and Prettier to catch any remaining issues.
5. Add/expand tests for critical hooks and components.
6. Check for unused files and remove them.

### Example `tsconfig.json` paths for absolute imports:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@features/*": ["features/*"],
      "@common/*": ["common/*"],
      "@context/*": ["context/*"],
      "@layout/*": ["layout/*"],
      "@pages/*": ["pages/*"],
      "@types": ["types.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```
