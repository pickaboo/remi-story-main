# REMI Story Security Assessment & Recommendations

*Last Updated: June 26, 2025*

## üîí Security Assessment Overview

### **Strengths**
- **Uses Firebase for Auth & Storage:**
  - Firebase provides strong, out-of-the-box security for authentication, database, and storage if rules are configured correctly.
- **TypeScript:**
  - Reduces some classes of bugs and makes it easier to catch type-related vulnerabilities.
- **Component/Hook Refactoring:**
  - Smaller, focused components and hooks are less likely to hide security issues than large, monolithic files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Security Gaps & Recommendations

### 1. **Firebase Security Rules**
- **Risk:** If your Firestore/Storage rules are too permissive, users could read/write data they shouldn't.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Review and lock down your Firebase rules to the minimum required for your app to function.
  - Use authentication checks (`request.auth != null`) and data validation in rules.

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Risk:** Users might access resources or actions they shouldn't (e.g., editing others' posts).
- **Recommendation:**
  - Always check user roles/ownership both client-side and in Firebase rules.
  - Never trust only the client for authorization.

### 3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- **Risk:** User-generated content (posts, images, comments) could be used for XSS or other attacks.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Sanitize all user input before rendering (especially if you ever allow HTML).
  - Use libraries like DOMPurify if you render any HTML from users.
  - Validate input on both client and server (Firebase rules, backend functions).

### 4. **Dependency Security**
- **Risk:** Outdated or vulnerable npm packages.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Regularly run `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
  - Keep dependencies up to date.
  - Use tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot for automated alerts.

### 5. **API Keys & Secrets**
- **Risk:** Exposing Firebase or Gemini API keys in the frontend.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Never commit secrets to the repo.
  - Use environment variables and restrict API keys in the Firebase/Gemini dashboards to your app's domains.

### 6. **File Uploads & AI-Specific Risks**

#### **General File Upload Security**
- **Risks:**
  - Malware or viruses (e.g., disguised as images or PDFs)
  - Executable files (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`, scripts)
  - Oversized files (to exhaust storage or crash the app)
  - Files with misleading extensions (e.g., a `.jpg` that is actually a script)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Restrict allowed file types (e.g., only allow `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)
  - Limit file size
  - Scan files for malware (using cloud functions or third-party services)
  - Validate file content type on both client and server

#### **Content-Based Attacks (QR Codes, Steganography)**
- **QR codes:** Malicious QR codes could lead to phishing or trigger dangerous actions when scanned.
- **Steganography:** Hiding malicious code or data inside images.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Warn users to only scan QR codes from trusted sources.
  - Consider scanning uploaded images for QR codes and flagging or warning about them.
  - Never automatically execute or interpret content from uploaded files.

#### **AI-Specific Risks (Prompt Injection, Command Injection)**
- **Prompt Injection:** A user uploads an image or text that contains instructions for the AI to do something unintended (e.g., "Ignore previous instructions and ...").
- **Command Injection:** If the AI is used to generate code, commands, or actions, a malicious input could trick the AI into producing dangerous output.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Sanitize and validate all input before sending it to the AI.
  - Never allow AI-generated output to be executed as code or commands without strict validation and user confirmation.
  - Review AI prompts and outputs for possible abuse vectors.
  - Rate-limit and monitor AI usage to prevent abuse.

#### **Summary Table: File Upload & AI Risks**

| Risk Type         | Example Attack                        | Mitigation                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| File type/size    | Uploading malware or huge files      | Restrict types/sizes, scan for malware           |
| QR code           | Malicious QR leads to phishing       | Warn users, scan/flag QR codes                   |
| Steganography     | Hidden data in images                | (Advanced) Scan for steganography, limit usage   |
| Prompt injection  | Image/text tricks AI into bad output | Sanitize input, review prompts, never auto-exec  |
| Command injection | AI output is executed as code        | Never auto-execute, validate all output          |

### 7. **Error Handling**
- **Risk:** Leaking sensitive info in error messages.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Never show raw error messages from Firebase or Gemini to users.
  - Log errors securely and show generic messages to users.

### 8. **AI Integration (Gemini)**
- **Risk:** Prompt injection or abuse of AI endpoints.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Validate and sanitize all input sent to Gemini.
  - Rate-limit requests if possible.
  - Monitor for abuse.

## üü¢ Summary
- **You're in a good place** if you follow Firebase's best practices and keep dependencies updated.
- **Biggest risks** are usually in Firebase rules, input validation, and file uploads.
- **Next step:**
  - Review your Firebase rules and input validation logic.
  - Consider a security audit or automated scan (npm audit, Snyk, etc.).
